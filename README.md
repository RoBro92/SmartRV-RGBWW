# SmartRV RGBWW Controller
**A ESP32 based RGBWW controller**

All feature requests are tracked in the GitHub issue tracker. 
[Feature Requests](https://github.com/RoBro92/feature-requests/issues)

This RGBWW control board has been designed to allow smart control of an attached LED strip. It supports 5 seperate channels that are switched via N Channel Mosfets, this is sutiable for the majority of LV LED devices. It is designed to integrate with a home automation system such as Home Assistant, though can operate standalone via an access point.

The module has been kept as compact as possible and allows for a direct connection to 12v or 24v vehicle systems. 

**If you want to support the development you can purchase this board as a DIY kit or assembled from my Ko-Fi Shop [SmartRV Shop](https://ko-fi.com/smartrv/shop)**
